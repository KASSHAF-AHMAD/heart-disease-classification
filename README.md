# heart-disease-classification

In this project, a heart disease classification dataset was utilized to perform an in-depth analysis of different machine learning algorithms for accurate heart disease diagnosis. The primary objective was to compare the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (k-NNC), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree classifiers in accurately classifying heart disease cases.

The project began with data preprocessing, involving tasks such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and handling missing values. The heart disease dataset, containing various clinical and demographic attributes, was then divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the algorithms' performance.

Each classifier was implemented and fine-tuned using appropriate hyperparameters to ensure optimal performance. SVM, known for its ability to handle complex decision boundaries, was configured with various kernel functions. Random Forest, a powerful ensemble method, was tuned for the number of trees and maximum depth. k-NNC was optimized for the number of neighbors, Logistic Regression for regularization strength, and Decision Tree for tree depth and impurity metrics.
